React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. Redux and React Router are respective examples of such libraries.",

JSX gets compiled to React.createElement() calls which return plain JavaScript objects called 'React elements'. These objects are then used to build the DOM.",
